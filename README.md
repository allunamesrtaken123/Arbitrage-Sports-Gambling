# Arbitrage-Sports-Gambling

Aribtrage betting entails placing a bet on both sides of a bet such that you are guaranteed to have no loss. Finding such opportunities
is not something a person can do efficiently or reliably, hence the use of computers!

This is a very basic script that will survey the offered lines for basketball or football (American) on sportsline.com and see if 
any arbitrage opportunities are present. If so, it will report which sportsbooks to place each bet and how much to place. 

Some valuable next steps for this project include automating the bet placing process and creating an infrastructure that allows the script
to run on a schedule. It would also be a more useful script if more books could be considered each time (especially international
sportsbooks).
